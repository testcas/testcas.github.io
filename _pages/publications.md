### [Is an Image Worth a Thousand Votes? Evidence from a Natural Experiment in Political Advertising](http://testcas.github.io/files/EstebanCasanelles_PolAdv.pdf)

I measure the effects of street-level political advertising on voting behavior. I use a novel dataset on ad location in a major Spanish city during elections for the national parliament as well as granular socio-economic and voting data. This set-up, where more than two parties are running for office and elections are very competitive, allows me to explore the heterogeneous effects of ads across parties as well as how parties' ads affect other parties' vote shares.
To identify the effects of parties' ads, I exploit a legally mandated randomized assignment of ad location to parties across multiple years. I find that a party's own ads have a positive effect on its vote share, although the effects are heterogeneous across parties. A one standard deviation increase in the number of ads increases a party's vote share by 0.87 percentage points on average. Ads of parties with ideologically distant platforms consistently have a negative effect on a party's vote share. In contrast, ads of parties that are close competitors may act either as complements or substitutes in different years.

### [Better the Devil You Don’t Know? Economic Shocks, New Party Emergence, and Changes in Voting Behavior](http://testcas.github.io/files/EstebanCasanelles_NewPartiesShocks.pdf)

This paper analyses the effects of an economic shock on the emergence of new parties and other changes in voting parties by using regional variation in the exposure to the shock. I find that a worsening of economic conditions as measured by unemployment rate leads to an increase in electoral competition and volatility. In particular, the deeper the effects of the recession in a area, the larger the number of new parties emerge and become more successful and there is an increase in the changes in vote shares. On the other hand, the vote share of parties previously in government decreases and a decrease in vote share concentration.


### [Incentives and Strategic Behaviour: An Experiment](http://testcas.github.io/files/EstebanCasanellesGoncalves_EIBCG.pdf)
with [Duarte Gonçalves](https://duartegoncalves.com/)

How and why do incentive levels affect strategic behaviour? This paper examines an experiment designed to identify the causal effect of scaling up incentives on choices,
beliefs, and response times in dominance-solvable games. Higher incentives increase action sophistication and decrease mistake propensity, while beliefs become more accurate, and response times longer. We provide evidence that higher incentives increase cognitive effort, as proxied by longer response times, which in turn is associated with improved performance and predicts choice sophistication and belief accuracy. Overall, the data lend support to both payoff-dependent mistakes and costly reasoning models.
